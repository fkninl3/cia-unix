# cia-unix

*Decrypt CIA roms in UNIX environments* ü™ê
<br></br>
<br>Fork of shijimasoft cia-unix repository. Changed the matching case to ignore case because my build of crystal regex is case sensitive.</br>

#### Requirements
* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/)
* [PyCrypto](https://pypi.org/project/pycrypto/) 
  * `pip install pycrypto` or `easy_install pycrypto`

> **Note**
> A new Python 3 (unstable) version has been released, you can find the experimental code [here](https://github.com/shijimasoft/cia-unix/tree/experimental).

```
cia-unix/
‚îú‚îÄ cia-unix
‚îú‚îÄ decrypt.py
‚îú‚îÄ ctrtool
‚îú‚îÄ makerom
‚îî‚îÄ Encrypted Game.cia
```
**ctrtool**, **makerom** and **decrypt.py** can be downloaded with `dltools.sh`

## üìã Roadmap
- [x] Decrypt .cia
  - [x] Games
  - [x] Patch and DLCs
- [x] Decrypt .3ds
- [ ] Rust/C++ 'decrypt.py' rewrite

> **Warning**
> Decryption with cia-unix may fail, when it happens it is suggested to decrypt roms directly on the 3DS.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Build from source
You‚Äôll need the [Crystal compiler](https://crystal-lang.org/install/)

```
crystal build cia-unix.cr --release --no-debug
```

Dependencies can be compiled with [makerom](https://github.com/3DSGuy/Project_CTR/tree/master/makerom) and [ctrtool](https://github.com/3DSGuy/Project_CTR/tree/master/ctrtool) make files

## Contributors
ctrtool and makerom are from [3DSGuy repository](https://github.com/3DSGuy/Project_CTR)

*Adaware* contributed translating the [windows-only version](https://github.com/matiffeder/3DS-stuff/blob/master/Batch%20CIA%203DS%20Decryptor.bat)
